# Solar System Simulation

This project is a visual representation of our solar system's celestial bodies. It shows the sun, the eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), and Earth's moon. The sizes of the celestial bodies and their distances from the sun are not to scale, but this project provides a conceptual understanding of their motion around the sun (or in the case of the moon, around Earth).

## Features
- 3D representation of the solar system's celestial bodies using SVGs.
- Celestial bodies are animated to revolve in orbits.
- Dynamic positioning of celestial bodies.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use
Clone this repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Future Scope
- The representation can be made more accurate by considering elliptical orbits.
- More celestial bodies, like other moons and the dwarf planets, can be added.
